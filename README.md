A few quick general notes:
 - the data cleaning and pre-processing procedure is thoroughly documented in the given html file
 - to run the report, PowerBI needs to be installed
 - to run the code unzip and extract the data files in the same folder

A few quick notes on the report:
 - the visuals are easy to understand, clicking on a particular visual changes the report for the respective specific case
 - to return to a general report, click on the same visual but not on anything that signifies an attribute from the data table
 - to get a report for a very specific time range, use the filter in the filter pane on the right, other than that you can use the time slicer
